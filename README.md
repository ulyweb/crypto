### Here's some info to get you started:

**1\. Getting Started:**

* I recommend starting with Coinbase, it's easy to use: [Coinbase link](https://coinbase.com/join/4R3JHCC)  
* Robinhood is another option, but Coinbase offers more crypto choices: [Robinhood link](https://join.robinhood.com/ulyssef1)  
* Uphold is good too, especially if you want to explore other assets beyond crypto: [Uphold link](https://wallet.uphold.com/signup?referral=358c417081&campaign=uw_p_d_w_acq_raf&utm_source=raf&utm_medium=referafriend)

**2\. Buying Your First Crypto:**

* **Coinbase Guide:**  
  * **Verify your identity:** Coinbase will need some basic info to comply with regulations.  
  * **Link a payment method:** Connect your bank account or debit card.  
  * **Search for XRP:** Type "XRP" in the search bar.  
  * **Enter the amount:** Decide how much you want to invest (start small\!).  
  * **Review and buy:** Double-check everything and click "Buy."

**3\. Understanding XRP:**

* XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap international transfers. It might play a bigger role in finance in the future, but it's important to do your own research. [Article of XRP History](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/xrp-a-history)

**4\. Important Things to Remember:**

* **Security:**  
  * **Account Security:** When you create your accounts on Coinbase, Robinhood, or Uphold make sure to enable 2-factor authentication (2FA). This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from an authenticator app on your phone in addition to your password. Don't rely just on SMS or email verification – use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy. This makes your account much more secure because you control the codes.  
  * **Crypto Storage:** It's totally fine to keep your XRP on Coinbase, Robinhood, or Upload, when you're just starting out, especially if you have less than $500 worth. But, if you buy more and your investment goes over $500, you want to keep it safer.  
    * **Xaman App:** The Xaman Wallet app is a self-custody wallet, which means you'll have full control over your XRP. It's like putting your money in a secure bank account that only you have the key to.  
    * **Even Better \- Cold Wallets:** For even stronger security, consider a "cold wallet" like the Tangem card. These wallets store your crypto completely offline, making them super secure from hackers. You can get a Tangem card here: [TangemCARD](https://redirect.sale/tangem/?promocode=8PWWLW)  
    * Here's why using a self-custody wallet (like Xaman or a cold wallet Tangem) is important:  
      * **Your keys, your coins:** When you use a self-custody wallet, you're in control of your XRP. It's like having the only key to your own safe. No one else can access it.  
      * **Exchange risks:** Keeping your crypto on Coinbase, Robinhood, or Upload is convenient, but there's a small risk that something could happen to the exchange (like hackers or technical problems). With a self-custody wallet, your XRP is much safer.  
      * **Write down your seed phrase\!** When you set up a self-custody wallet, it'll give you a "seed phrase" – a list of words or numbers. This is like the master key to your wallet. Write it down and keep it somewhere super safe (like a fireproof box or a safe deposit box). If you lose your phone or wallet, you can use this phrase to recover your XRP.

* **ISO 20022:** This is a set of rules for financial messaging. Some people believe that cryptocurrencies that follow these rules could be more important in the future. Some notable ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies include
   * **Ripple's (XRP)**  
   * **Stellar Lumens (XLM)**  
   * **IOTA (MIOTA)**  
   * **Algorand (ALGO)**
   * **Quant (QNT)**  
   * **Hedera HashGraph (HBAR)**  
   * **XDC Network (XDC)**

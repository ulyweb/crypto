  <h3>Welcome to Your Cryptocurrency Investing Journey</h3>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>1. Getting Started:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I recommend starting with Coinbase, it's easy to use: <a href="https://coinbase.com/join/4R3JHCC">Coinbase link</a></li>
      <li>Robinhood is another option, but Coinbase offers more crypto choices: <a href="https://join.robinhood.com/ulyssef1">Robinhood link</a></li>
      <li>Uphold is good too, especially if you want to explore other assets beyond crypto: <a href="https://wallet.uphold.com/signup?referral=358c417081&campaign=uw_p_d_w_acq_raf&utm_source=raf&utm_medium=referafriend">Uphold link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <p><strong>2. Buying Your First Crypto:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Coinbase Guide:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Verify your identity:</strong> Coinbase will need some basic info to comply with regulations.</li>
          <li><strong>Link a payment method:</strong> Connect your bank account or debit card.</li>
          <li><strong>Search for XRP:</strong> Type "XRP" in the search bar.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter the amount:</strong> Decide how much you want to invest (start small!).</li>
          <li><strong>Review and buy:</strong> Double-check everything and click "Buy."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>3. Understanding XRP:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap international transfers. It might play a bigger role in finance in the future, but it's important to do your own research. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/xrp-a-history">Article of XRP History</a></li>

    <p><strong>4. Important Things to Remember:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account Security:</strong> When you create your accounts on Coinbase, Robinhood, or Uphold, make sure to enable 2-factor authentication (2FA). This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from an authenticator app on your phone in addition to your password. Don't rely just on SMS or email verification – use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy. This makes your account much more secure because you control the codes.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crypto Storage:</strong> It's totally fine to keep your XRP on Coinbase, Robinhood, or Uphold when you're just starting out, especially if you have less than $500 worth. But, if you buy more and your investment goes over $500, you want to keep it safer.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Xaman App:</strong> The Xaman Wallet app is a self-custody wallet, which means you'll have full control over your XRP. It's like putting your money in a secure bank account that only you have the key to.</li>
              <li><strong>Even Better - Cold Wallets:</strong> For even stronger security, consider a "cold wallet" like the Tangem card. These wallets store your crypto completely offline, making them super secure from hackers. You can get a Tangem card here: <a href="https://redirect.sale/tangem/?promocode=8PWWLW">TangemCARD</a></li>
              <li>
                Here's why using a self-custody wallet (like Xaman or a cold wallet) is important:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Your keys, your coins:</strong> When you use a self-custody wallet, you're in control of your XRP. It's like having the only key to your own safe. No one else can access it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Exchange risks:</strong> Keeping your crypto on Coinbase, Robinhood, or Uphold is convenient, but there's a small risk that something could happen to the exchange (like hackers or technical problems). With a self-custody wallet, your XRP is much safer.</li>
                  <li><strong>Write down your seed phrase!</strong> When you set up a self-custody wallet, it'll give you a "seed phrase" – a list of words. This is like the master key to your wallet. Write it down and keep it somewhere super safe (like a fireproof box or a safe deposit box). If you lose your phone, you can use this phrase to recover your XRP.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ISO 20022:</strong> This is a set of rules for financial messaging. Some people believe that cryptocurrencies that follow these rules could be more important in the future. Some notable ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies include:

        <strong>Risk:</strong> Crypto can be volatile! <strong>Only invest what you can afford to lose</strong> and, <strong>do not forget it's important to do your own research.</strong> 
        <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #6c757d;">This is not financial advice.  Any investment decisions should be made after conducting your own research and consulting with a financial advisor.</p>
